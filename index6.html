                    <p>This image illustrates the architecture of a cybersecurity test bench designed to optimize communication in the context of autonomous vehicles. At the heart of the system is the MQTT server, which acts as a central hub facilitating real-time data exchange, including geolocation and speed information. Vehicles communicate with the server by subscribing to relevant topics, allowing them to publish and receive critical data.

                        To secure these communications, multiple layers of protection are implemented. TLS (Transport Layer Security) ensures encrypted data transmission, while Mutual Authentication via Certificates and Password-Based Authentication protect against unauthorized access. A Firewall further strengthens security by filtering traffic and blocking potential threats.
                        
                        The image also highlights the Study of Latency, where the impact of encryption key sizes on latency is analyzed. Data flows between the server and vehicles (Cars A and B) are tested with different authentication key sizes to optimize performance without compromising security. This latency analysis helps ensure minimal delays in data transmission, a critical factor for real-time decision-making in smart city environments.</p>

                    <p>This is the configuration interface for establishing secure communication between autonomous vehicles and the MQTT server. The interface allows the user to input critical information such as the brokerâ€™s IP address, username, and password. Security features such as Encryption and Authentication are enabled, ensuring that data transmission is protected using TLS and mutual authentication protocols.

                        Users can also select the RSA key size for encryption, with options like RSA_1024, ensuring a balance between security and performance. Once the required information is filled, users can establish a connection by clicking the "Connect" button. The interface will display the connection status, with a clear indication when the system is disconnected or connected.
                        
                        This intuitive configuration interface provides an easy-to-use platform for setting up and managing secure vehicle-to-server communication, making the system accessible even to users without extensive technical expertise. </p>

                    <p>This interface allows users to perform latency tests to evaluate the impact of different encryption key sizes on the authentication process. The user can initiate the test by clicking the "Launch Latency Test" button, after which the system measures the latency for various key sizes, such as RSA_256, RSA_512, RSA_1024, Curve448, and P-256.

                        The results are displayed on the right side of the interface, where a bar chart shows the correlation between key size and authentication latency. As shown in the graph, larger key sizes typically result in higher latency, providing valuable insights for optimizing the balance between security and performance in the autonomous vehicle communication network. The test can be stopped at any point by clicking the "Stop Latency Test" button.
                        
                        This test is critical for determining the most efficient encryption configurations, ensuring both secure and real-time communication in a smart city mobility context. </p>
